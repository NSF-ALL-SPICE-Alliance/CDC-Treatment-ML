# Welcome to our Overdose Data to Action (OD2A) Repository

This collaboration between All-SPICE and OD2A leverages data visualization and machine learning to understand national and Hawaii specific trends in Substance Abuse Treatment. The primary dataset for this research is the [Treatment Episode Dataset (TEDS)](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/teds-treatment-episode-data-set)

### Predictive Analysis of Successful Treatment Outcomes

There is tremendous potential in leveraging machine learning algorithms (random forests utilized here) to recognize patterns and non-linear relationships between variables in TEDS. 

This work is in the publication process and more details explaining the analysis will be available soon 



### Comparison of Outcomes by Service Setting for Substance Abuse Treatment in Hawaii

[Brittany Johnson](https://github.com/Brittanysas) , a senior Nursing student at Chaminade University of Honolulu and Veteran, built upon her data science skills while investigating the role of service setting in sun=bstance abuse treatment outcomes in Hawaii.
